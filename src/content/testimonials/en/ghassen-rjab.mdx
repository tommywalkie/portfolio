I had the pleasure of working with Tom for two years at MadKudu. He's an exceptionally talented and pragmatic web developer, equally skilled in backend and frontend development. Tom is always on the lookout for the latest tools and libraries that can genuinely improve the stack. Thanks to him, we integrated TanStack React Query and TypeORM, which significantly boosted our efficiency and developer experience.

Beyond work, what consistently amazed me was Tom's dedication to side projects with his friends. His passion for building things never fades, and he's always pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas.

I wholeheartedly recommend Tom. Any team would be lucky to have him!
