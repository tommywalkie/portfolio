I had the chance to have Tom on my team at MadKudu for two years.
Tom is a passionate and dedicated software engineer. He approached every new project with enthusiasm and a drive to push himself further, while also handling less gratifying but essential tasks with dedication. His involvement was always strong, whether in designing new projects, where he contributed even to UI/UX design, in development, where his code was consistently clean, or in customer support. I could always count on him.
Highly valued by his peers, he was always willing to lend a hand or join a pair programming session. Finally, Tom is a true example of self-improvement: constantly striving to grow, questioning himself, and actively seeking feedback to get better every day
